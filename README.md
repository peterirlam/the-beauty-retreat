## ðŸŽ± &nbsp; Why I Chose This Project

As a self-taught, junior web developer, I have demonstrated my skills through plenty of personal projects. 
However, I also needed to evidence commercial experience working on real projects for real clients, meeting their specifications and 
delivering a visually stunning, functional & responsive product on time and within budget. 

Fiverr.com seemed a great choice and after spending a good deal of time creating a compelling and professional accound, I landed my first gig for a local
business wishing to take the next step by adding an online presence.

## 🎱 &nbsp; Why I Chose This Project

As a self-taught, junior web developer, I have demonstrated my skills through plenty of personal projects. 
However, I also needed to evidence commercial experience working on real projects for real clients, meeting their specifications and 
delivering a visually stunning, functional & responsive product on time and within budget. 

Fiverr.com seemed a great choice and after spending a good deal of time creating a compelling and professional accound, I landed my first gig for a local
business wishing to take the next step by adding an online presence.

## 🏗️ &nbsp; How I Worked on This Project

- This project was ordered by a freelance client onFiverr.com. 
- I began the process with a free dedicated strategy session with my client to discuss the project, type of website including personality, look & feel, 
marketing goals and ways of achieving them. 
- I advised on branding colours, layout and I also provided all images free of charge.
- I updated my client regularly with 'milestones'.
- I worked with tasks using Trello as a project management tool
- I completed and shipped the finished project almost a day before the deadline.
